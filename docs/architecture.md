# Architecture

## Overview

Resume Refinery uses a deterministic orchestrator with bounded specialist agents.
A session is created for each job application and stores all versions of generated
documents, review outputs, and source inputs.

## Career Repository Storage

Career repositories live in `~/.resume_refinery/careers/` by default.
Override with `RESUME_REFINERY_CAREERS_DIR` env var.

```
~/.resume_refinery/careers/
└── jordan-lee/
    └── career.json          ← Full structured career data (single JSON)
```

A `CareerRepository` can be flattened into a `CareerProfile` via
`to_career_profile()`, making it a drop-in replacement for file-uploaded
career profiles in the existing pipeline.

### Document Ingest

The `IngestAgent` (in `ingest_agent.py`) processes each uploaded document
(PDF, DOCX, TXT/MD) in a separate LLM call, giving each file the full
context window. The extraction prompt includes field-level guidance that
mirrors the wizard's helper text, ensuring the LLM fills each field
appropriately and completely.

After all documents are extracted, `consolidate_repo()` merges duplicate
roles (matched by company + title + overlapping dates) and deduplicates
skills (case-insensitive name match, keeping highest proficiency). A final
`compose_stories()` LLM call generates STAR behavioural stories from the
merged accomplishments.

Each role and story carries an `extraction_confidence` rating (`high` /
`medium` / `low`) and `confidence_notes` so the wizard can surface
low-confidence areas for user review.

```
Upload: resume.pdf + perf_review_2024.pdf + perf_review_2025.pdf
         │
         ▼
    parsers._read_file_content()  (per file: PDF, DOCX, TXT)
         │
         ▼
    IngestAgent.ingest_to_repo()  ×N  (one LLM call per document)
         │
         ▼
    consolidate_repo()  (LLM-based merge: roles, skills, text)
         │
         ▼
    IngestAgent.compose_stories()  (one LLM call on merged data)
         │
         ▼
    CareerRepository (pre-filled with confidence scores)
         │
         ▼
    Wizard Phase 3 (role deep-dive) — low-confidence roles first
```

## Session Storage

Sessions live in `~/.resume_refinery/sessions/` by default.
Override with `RESUME_REFINERY_SESSIONS_DIR` env var.

```

## Review and Artifact JSON Schemas

Each version directory can contain the following JSON files. All are emitted by the
orchestrator and correspond to Pydantic models in `models.py`.

### `truth_review.json` — `TruthfulnessResult`

```json
{
  "all_supported": false,
  "cover_letter": {
    "pass_strict": true,
    "unsupported_claims": [],
    "evidence_examples": ["Reduced infra costs by $180K/year (career profile, Acme Corp)"]
  },
  "resume": {
    "pass_strict": false,
    "unsupported_claims": ["Led a team of 12 engineers"],
    "evidence_examples": []
  },
  "interview_guide": {
    "pass_strict": true,

### `exempted_phrases.json` — `ExemptedPhrases`

Only written when the repair agent accepted at least one item as a false positive.

```json
{
  "claims": ["Led cross-functional initiatives"],
  "ai_phrases": ["results-driven"],
  "voice_issues": []
}
```

### `evidence_pack.json` — `EvidencePack`

```json
{
  "job_requirements": [
    {"requirement": "distributed systems", "category": "skill", "source_excerpt": "..."}
  ],
  "matched_evidence": [
    {"requirement": "distributed systems", "evidence": "Built event-driven pipeline...", "source_excerpt": "...", "relevance_score": 4}
  ],
  "gaps": ["No Kubernetes experience mentioned"],
  "source_summary": ["Reduced infra costs by $180K/year"]
}
```

### `voice_guide.json` — `VoiceStyleGuide`

```json
{
  "core_adjectives": ["direct", "analytical"],
  "style_rules": ["Short declarative sentences", "Avoid adverbs"],
  "preferred_phrases": ["I built", "We shipped"],
  "phrases_to_avoid": ["passionate about", "results-driven"],
  "writing_samples": ["Sample paragraph from voice profile..."]
}
```

## Design Decisions

**Bounded agentic design:** Specialist agents are role-constrained and never control
the global workflow. The orchestrator owns step order, retries, and persistence.

**Intermediate artifacts for explainability:** `EvidencePack` and `VoiceStyleGuide`
are explicit artifacts that can be inspected in the UI and reasoned about in reviews.

**Per-document generation:** Each document remains a separate Claude API call, which keeps
targeted refinement cheap and traceable.

**Adaptive thinking enabled:** All Claude calls use `thinking: {type: "adaptive"}`. This
is especially valuable for the review passes, where the model needs to reason carefully
about voice match and AI-detection signals before producing a JSON result.

**Verification gates:** Truthfulness, voice match, and AI-detection are treated as
separate verification concerns. The truthfulness reviewer receives the career profile
and job description as grounding sources; voice and AI-detection reviewers operate
only on the documents and voice profile. Truth checks run before final acceptance,
and repair passes target only failing documents.

**Raw content over structured parsing:** Input files are passed to Claude as raw text.
This is intentional — flexible, user-friendly input formats are more important than
schema rigidity at the ingestion stage. Structured extraction is only used for session
naming.

**DOCX output:** python-docx produces Word documents without requiring Pandoc (an
external binary). The Markdown source is also preserved alongside the DOCX for easy
diffing and re-export.
